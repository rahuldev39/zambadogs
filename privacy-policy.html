   <h4>Host and Customer Representations, Acknowledgments and Obligations</h4>

   <p>By agreeing to serve as a host and board dogs or provide other dog-related services ("Host") to a Customer (defined hereinafter), you expressly assume the risk of any damages, including property damages or personal injury, which you or anyone else present in your residence may suffer. It is the sole responsibility of Hosts to make decisions that are in the best interests of themselves and their pets. It is strongly recommended that all Hosts schedule a "Previsit" with all dogs and dog parentsbefore providing dog boarding or other dog-related services to mitigate as many risks as possible.

</p>

<p>Should you agree to serve as a Host and you have any adults and children under the age of 18 at your home, you agree and acknowledge as follows:

</p>

<ul>
<li>We agree that we (the adults and I, on behalf of my children/child/ward) are voluntarily agreeing to board a dog belonging to another at our home. I am assuming, on behalf of myself and/or my children/child/ward, all risk of personal injury, death or disability to me and/or my child/ward that might result or arise from the boarding of this dog in my home, or any damage, loss or harm to my reason or personal property which I or my children/child/ward may incur. I understand that the risks that come with boarding a dog who is not accustomed to me, my children/child/ward, and my home and that it has inherent risks; and</li>
<li>I agree on behalf of myself and/or my children/child/ward and my/their personal representatives, successors, heirs, and assigns to hold Hobbes Dog Care Technologies Private Limited, its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees, and customers (collectively, the "Releases") harmless from any and all claims or causes of action arising out of the boarding of this dog in my home. I expressly release and discharge Releases from any and all liability, claims, demands or causes of action whatsoever arising out of any damage, loss, personal injury or death to me and/or my children/child/ward, while the dog is boarding in my home.</li>
<li>This release is valid and effective whether the damage, loss or death is a result of any act or omission on the part of any of Releases or from any other cause. This waiver and release of all liability includes, without limitation, any injuries, illness, or accidents, which may occur as a result of the dog boarding in my home. By proceeding with this transaction, I understand that I voluntarily give up my right to sue the above mentioned parties.</li>

</ul>


<p>The Owners of the guest pets (<strong>"Customer"</strong>) should ensure that the Host is provided with contact information to reach the Customer in the event an emergency medical situation arises involving a Customer's Dog. Customer and Hosts acknowledge and agree that, to the extent any situation arises where the Customer's Dog is required to receive emergency veterinary care while in the care or custody of the Host, the Host shall make reasonable efforts to contact the Customer and notify him or her of the situation.

If Customer cannot be reached following reasonable efforts, Customer authorizes Host to authorize care on his/her behalf in order to promptly treat Customer's dog. Customer acknowledge and agree that the costs of any such treatment for emergency medical situations is the sole and exclusive responsibility of the Customer and that Customer shall be liable to fully reimburse costs incurred by the Host thereto.
